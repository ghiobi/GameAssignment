Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.\n\nThroughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.

Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create-a-Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \"classic\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-a-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the \"superteams\" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.

An amalgamation of Psychic Force and Destrega, Evil Zone is a projectile-based 3D fighter that adds a dynamic element lacking from most of today's fighting games. Developed by Yuke's, the team behind the successful (in Japan at least) Toukon Retsuden series, and the not so successful Soukaigi (Square's recent action RPG), Evil Zone is a refreshing surprise from a development team not known for fighting games.\n\nThe premise in Evil Zone centers around the main character, Danvaizer, a superhero in the mold of classic Japanese afternoon TV shows (a la Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, etc.). While the storyline is truly superfluous, it nevertheless suffices as reason enough to gather Danvaizer and nine other combatants together to do battle in a distinctly different manner than most other fighting games.

The continent of Mardias serves as the game's primary world, and is divided into three kingdoms: Nightweld, the Valaimian Empire and Gerauld. The story begins as Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting Fazz.\n\nAs you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long however and the slider will return to the beginning.

When a line is created, the blocks in that line (or lines) disappear from the screen. Your job is to keep the pile of blocks from reaching the top of the playfield.\n\nThe Next Tetris mode of play introduces several new elements to the Tetris universe. The block-maneuvering action remains, but special multi-colored puzzle pieces that can separate and fall when they land enter the mix. Also, blocks above cleared lines will fall to spaces below, possibly setting up a chain reaction, which in this game is called a Cascade.
